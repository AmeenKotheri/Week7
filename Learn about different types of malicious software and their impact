a). Malware, Viruses, Worms, Keyloggers, Phishing, Smishing, Spoofing
1️⃣ Malware (Main Category)

Malware = any harmful software designed to damage systems or steal information.
It includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware… everything.

Impact:
Data theft
System damage
Unauthorized access
Financial loss
Privacy invasion

2️⃣ Viruses
A virus attaches itself to files or programs and spreads when those files are executed.

Impact:
Corrupt files
Slow system
Data loss
Spreads to USB drives, network

Example: Michelangelo Virus

3️⃣ Worms
Worms are similar to viruses but do NOT need user interaction.
They spread automatically through networks.

Impact:
Network congestion
System crashes
Used to deliver payloads like ransomware

Example: WannaCry worm

4️⃣ Keyloggers
Programs that record everything a user types.

Impact:
Steals passwords
Steals banking information
Total account takeover

Used in:
Hacking, spying, credential theft

5️⃣ Phishing
A social engineering attack where attackers trick users into giving personal information using emails or websites.

Impact:
Identity theft
Banking loss
Corporate data breaches

6️⃣ Smishing
Phishing via SMS messages.

Example:
Your bank account is blocked. Click this link.

7️⃣ Spoofing
Attacker pretends to be someone else (email, caller ID, IP address, website).

Impact:
Fake login pages
Man-in-the-middle attacks
Session hijacking

b).Spyware, backdoors, reverse shells, bind shells

1️⃣ Spyware
Malware that secretly monitors user activity.

Impact:
Tracks keystrokes
Screenshots
Browsing history
Sensitive data stolen

2️⃣ Backdoors
A hidden way to access a device/system without permission.

Impact:
Remote control of device
Persistent access
Pre-installed in many trojans

Example: RAT tools like njRAT, DarkComet

3️⃣ Reverse Shell
Victim connects back to the attacker’s machine.
Used when attacker cannot directly reach victim (behind firewall/NAT).

Impact:
Full remote access
Execution of commands
File upload/download

4️⃣ Bind Shell
Attacker connects directly to a port on the victim’s machine.
Victim → opens port
Attacker → connects

Impact:
Remote shell
Easier to detect by firewalls

c). Adware, trojans, rootkits

1️⃣ Adware
Displays unwanted ads in browsers or applications.

Impact:
Annoying ads
Pop-ups
Tracks browsing habits
May download more malware

2️⃣ Trojan (Trojan Horse)
Looks like a legitimate program but contains malicious code.

Impact:
Opens backdoor
Installs keyloggers
Steals credentials
Gives full control to attacker

Example: Fake “Cracked software” downloads

3️⃣ Rootkit
Allows attackers to hide their presence on a system.

Impact:
Hides malware
Gives admin-level access
Nearly impossible to detect
Used in advanced persistent threats (APT)
