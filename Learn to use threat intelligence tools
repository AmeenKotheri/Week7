Learn to use threat intelligence tools
a). VirusTotal
b). AlienVault OTX

VirusTotal (VT):

Web + API service that aggregates antivirus/URL scanners, sandboxing, and community intelligence to analyze files, URLs, domains, and IPs.
Great for fast triage of suspicious files, hashes, URLs, and seeing community context and behavioral reports.

AlienVault OTX (Open Threat Exchange):

Threat-intel sharing platform where researchers publish “pulses” (collections of IOCs) and contextual info.
Good for ongoing threat hunting and populating SIEM/blocks with community-sourced IOCs.

practical workflow:
Detect — get an alert (email link, suspicious file hash, outbound connection to odd domain).
Lookup — search the indicator (hash / URL / domain / IP) in VirusTotal and OTX.
Enrich — gather AV detections, sandbox behavior, YARA hits, related indicators, pulses, and tags.
Assess — evaluate severity: confirmed malicious, suspicious, or benign (use CVSS/CVE context if present).
Respond — block indicator at firewall/proxy, isolate host, or blacklist domain; add to SIEM for correlation.
Document — store IoCs and decision in ticketing/RCA and optionally share back to OTX or internal MISP.

Using VirusTotal — step-by-step:

Web UI (fast triage)
1.Open https://www.virustotal.com/
2.Paste a file, hash, URL, domain, or IP into the search box.
3.Read the Summary: detection ratio (e.g., 20/70), scan date, first/last seen.
4.Check Detections tab: which engines flagged it and which names they used.
5.Check Behavior / Sandbox (if available): API calls, network connections, created files, dropped files.
6.Use the Relations / Graph to find related domains, files, or IPs.
7.Look at Community comments, YARA matches, and any VT Intelligence tags.

Using AlienVault OTX — step-by-step:

Web UI
1.Go to https://otx.alienvault.com/ and create a free account.
2.Use the search bar to lookup a domain, IP, or file hash.
3.View Pulses: collections of IoCs and context (attack patterns, indicators, MITRE ATT&CK mapping).
4.Review Pulse details: indicators list, tags, confidence, and references.
5.Subscribe to pulses to receive updates.
