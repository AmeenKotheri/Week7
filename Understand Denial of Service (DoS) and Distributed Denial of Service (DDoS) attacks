DoS (Denial of Service) — an attack that attempts to make a machine, service, or network resource unavailable to legitimate users by exhausting resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, sockets, etc.).

DDoS (Distributed DoS) — the same goal, but the attack traffic comes from many distributed systems (a botnet or many compromised hosts), making it harder to block and far more powerful.

Impact: downtime, lost revenue, reputational damage, diversion for other attacks (e.g., while defenders react to DDoS, attackers perform data theft).

DDoS works by overwhelming one or more resources used by a service. 
There are three common categories of DDoS attack vectors:
Volumetric (Flood) attacks
Aim: saturate the target’s network bandwidth or upstream link.
Examples: UDP flood, ICMP flood, NTP/Chargen amplification.
Mechanic: send huge volumes of traffic (packets/bytes) until link or appliance is saturated.

Protocol (State-exhaustion) attacks
Aim: consume resources in network equipment or in the OS network stack (connection tables, stateful firewalls).
Examples: SYN flood, fragmented packet attacks, TCP connection exhaustion.
Mechanic: create half-open connections or many stateful sessions so the server runs out of memory or socket slots.

Application-layer (L7) attacks
Aim: exhaust application server resources by mimicking legitimate requests (high CPU, DB queries).
Examples: HTTP GET/POST floods, slowloris (keeps HTTP connections open), targeted requests that trigger expensive DB operations.
Mechanic: fewer packets but high server-side cost per request; harder to distinguish from legitimate users.

Amplification & Reflection: Attackers frequently use third-party UDP protocols that respond with larger replies than the request (NTP, DNS, Memcached, CLDAP). They spoof the victim’s IP in the request so many reflected replies flood the victim — this amplifies attack bandwidth for low attacker cost.

Common tools & botnets used in DDoS:
Botnets made of compromised IoT devices, routers, or servers (e.g., Mirai family variants). Recent botnets target home routers, IP cameras, etc., because they are numerous and often insecure.
Attack orchestration tools and services (some sold as “DDoS for hire” / booters) let attackers launch multi-vector campaigns.

How to detect a DoS/DDoS attack (indicators):
Network indicators:
-Sudden, sustained spike in inbound traffic (bytes/sec) from many IPs.
-Many new TCP/UDP flows, high packet per second (pps) rates.
-Abnormal traffic types (lots of UDP to unusual ports, many SYNs without completes).
-Large numbers of requests for same URL or many distinct URLs at high rate (application attacks).

Host / service indicators:
-High CPU, memory, disk I/O on web servers or proxies.
-Exhausted connection tables, high number of TIME_WAIT or SYN_RECV states.
-Increased latency, timeouts, or application errors (502/503).
-Logs showing repeated identical or malformed requests.

Tools for detection:
-Flow collectors (NetFlow/sFlow/IPFIX) and analytics (look for spikes and unusual top talkers).
-IDS/IPS (Suricata, Snort) signatures and alerts for abnormal packet patterns.
-Server metrics: top, htop, ss -s, ss -tunp, netstat -s, webserver access logs, and APM tooling (New Relic, Datadog).
-Packet capture (tcpdump, Wireshark) for forensic inspection of traffic composition.

How to identify attack type quickly (triage checklist):
Check volumes: is inbound bandwidth near link capacity? → volumetric.
Inspect packet types: many UDP to high ports / many small packets → reflection/amplification.
Check TCP states: many SYN with few completes → SYN flood / protocol attack.
Look at HTTP logs: many requests per second, repeated user-agents or same resource → application-layer attack.

Quick commands (Linux):
ss -s (summary of socket states)
ss -tunp (show connections + owning process)
iftop/nethogs (live bandwidth per host/process)
tcpdump -n -c 1000 -w sample.pcap (capture sample traffic for analysis)

Mitigation & defenses (best practices, layered approach):
DDoS defense is multi-layered — combine on-prem, network, and cloud/provider controls.

Perimeter & network level:
-Rate limiting / traffic shaping at edge routers.
-Blackholing / sinkholing: drop all traffic to the attacked IP (last-resort).
-Anycast & distributed scrubbing: distribute traffic across many POPs, scrub bad traffic in the cloud/CDN before it hits origin.
-Upstream filtering: ISP or DDoS provider drop malicious flows.
-SYN cookies and tuning TCP backlog to resist SYN floods.

Application & transport level:
-WAF (Web Application Firewall) to block malicious HTTP patterns.
-Challenge-response (CAPTCHA/rate limits) to block automated requests.
-Connection limits & timeouts to reduce slow attacks (slowloris).
-Caching & CDNs to absorb volumetric requests and serve cached content.

Organizational & operational:
-DDoS protection services (Cloudflare, Akamai, Azure DDoS Protection, AWS Shield).
-Playbooks & runbooks: prewritten response plans and contact lists for ISPs and providers.
-Traffic baseline & monitoring to detect anomalies early.
-Capacity planning & redundancy: multi-region deployment and autoscaling.
